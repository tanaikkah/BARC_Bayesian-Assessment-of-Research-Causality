# barc-monte-carlo-simulation
BARC Monte Carlo Simulation. This repository contains the Python code for the Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis presented in **Appendix A.8** of the manuscript "Micro(nano)plastics and cancer link hypothesis:  applying the Bayesian assessment of research causality framework for transparent evidence integration in public health"

## About the Code
The script `barc_monte_carlo.py` performs a Bayesian sensitivity analysis for assessing the causal link between micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk, as described in the paper.

## How to Use
1.  Ensure you have Python installed with `numpy` and `scipy`.
2.  Run the script: `python barc_monte_carlo.py`
3.  The script will output diagnostic summaries and the posterior probability distribution.

## Reference
Please cite the accompanying manuscript if you use this code.
